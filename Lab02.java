        //2.	Write method sum which accepts a 2D array of integers and returns the sum of all of the elements. Use row-column traversal method.
                rowSum: rowSum accepts two parameters: a 2D array of integers and an integer row. rowSum returns the sum of the integers of elements in the row given by row. 
                colSum: colSum accepts two parameters: a 2D array of integers and an integer col. colSum returns the sum of the integers of elements in the column given by col. 
                sum2: This method is the same as sum above, but you must use rowSum method in your code. 

       // 3.	printTranspose: Given 2D array of integers, print the transpose of the array. The transpose of a 2D array is the array whose rows are the columns of the original array. 
                Do not create a new array, instead, use for loops to traverse the original array.
